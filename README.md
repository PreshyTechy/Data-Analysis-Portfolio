### LITA Project
This project is the test of knowledge of all that have been taught through out this journey with The incubator Hub on Data Analysis starting from Spreadsheet where Microsoft Excel was the spreadsheet used. the journey progressed to understanding the concept of cleaning data and while it is important to work with a clean dataset. 

### Data Source
The primary source od this project is LITA Capstone Dataset generated by The Incubtor Hub for the student project. Data can also be sourced from an open source such as kaggle or FRED or other repository data site.

### Tools Used
for this project, the tools used are
- Microsoft Excel [Click Here to Download](https://www.microsoft.com) for Data Cleaning, Analysis and for Visualization
- SQL (Structured Query Language for Data Querying
- Power BI for creating report, summarizing data and for Vistualzation
- Github for Building Portfolio.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
The inital phase of the Data Clening and preparation involves the following
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Handling Missing Varables

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA entails exploring Data to answer questions about the Data such as 
- What is the total revenue
- Which product is the Top sellers
- What are the Top and Bottom selling Products.

### Data Analysis
Here, i used some basic lines of codes, Queries and DAX expressions during the process of analysising the Data.

``` EXCEL
=DAYS(F2,E2)
```
```SQL
SELECT Region, Count(CustomerID) AS TotalNumberCustomer FROM [dbo].[CustomerDataCSV]
Group by Region 
Order by TotalNumberCustomer Desc
```
